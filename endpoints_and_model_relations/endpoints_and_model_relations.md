# Lesson 2 - Endpoints and Model Relations

I promised I'd post a walkthrough of setting up and using virtual environments with the `virtualenv` package, so [here it is](./virtualenv_walkthrough.md).

The code we wrote in this lesson can be found [here](https://github.com/SheCodesAus/she-codes-crowdfunding-api-project-Hauteclere/tree/session2).

It can be very helpful to take a look at the DRF documentation if you're looking for more info on how to customise the generic code for your project. In particular:
- [The documentation on **views**.](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/views/)
- [The writeup on **serializers**.](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/serializers/)
- [The list of **serializer fields** that DRF gives us.](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/fields/)
- And finally, [the docs for **serializer relations**](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/relations/). This last one can be tricky, so if you've had a go but are running into bugs, don't hesitate to come grab a mentor or pipe up in the Django help channel on Slack.

We're still using Django too, so don't forget that [its docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial02/#creating-models) are also a useful resource!
