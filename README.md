# SheCodesDRF2023Supplementary
A repo for the supplementary lesson materials that I create for the She Codes 2023 DRF cohort.

There might be only one, let's see how it goes...

* ## [Lesson One - Intro to DRF and APIs](./DRF_structure/DRF_structure.md)
* ## [Lesson Two - Creating Endpoints and Handling Model Relations](./endpoints_and_model_relations/endpoints_and_model_relations.md)
  * I promised I'd post a walkthrough of setting up and using virtual environments with the `virtualenv` package, so [here it is](./virtualenv/virtualenv_walkthrough.md).
* ## Lesson Three - Users
  * No major notes to share here - I shared the code we went through in class on Slack (it was slightly different to what's on Thinkific, but the thinkific code will work just fine). Also, [here's a link to the code as it was at the end of this lesson](https://github.com/SheCodesAus/she-codes-crowdfunding-api-project-Hauteclere/tree/lesson3).
* ## [Lesson Four - Permissions and Authentication](./permissions_and_authentication/permissions_and_authentication.md)
* ## [Intermezzo - Modifying Our User Serializer](./intermezzo/intermezzo.md) 
  * TBC! We ran through this in class during lesson 4, but I'll put some notes up when I have a moment.
* ## [Lesson Five - Deployment!](./deployment/deployment.md)
* ## [Appendix: Useful Peripheral Tech Tools](./peripheral_tools/peripheral_tools.md)
