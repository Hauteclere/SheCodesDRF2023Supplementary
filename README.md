# SheCodesDRF2023Supplementary
A repo for the supplementary lesson materials that I create for the She Codes 2023 DRF cohort.

There might be only one, let's see how it goes...

* ## [Lesson One - Intro to DRF and APIs](./DRF_structure/DRF_structure.md)
* ## [Lesson Two - Creating Endpoints and Handling Model Relations](./endpoints_and_model_relations/endpoints_and_model_relations.md)
  * I promised I'd post a walkthrough of setting up and using virtual environments with the `virtualenv` package, so [here it is](./virtualenv/virtualenv_walkthrough.md).
* ## Lesson Three
  * No major notes to share here - I shared the code we went through in class on Slack, and also [have a link to the repo](https://github.com/SheCodesAus/she-codes-crowdfunding-api-project-Hauteclere/tree/lesson3).
* ## [Appendix: Useful Peripheral Tech Tools](./peripheral_tools/peripheral_tools.md)
